## Project Overview

This project aims to forecast website traffic, using data preprocessing, visualization, and ARIMA-based time-series modeling to make accurate predictions. Forecasting website traffic is essential for business insights, allowing teams to plan content, manage resources, and enhance user engagement.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset `traffic1.csv` is used, containing daily website traffic data.
- **Features**:
  - **Date**: Date of each observation.
  - **Views**: Number of views recorded on each date.
- **Timeframe**: Year 2020 .

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and install the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly statsmodels scikit-learn
```

Or, install from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/website-traffic-forecasting.git
   cd website-traffic-forecasting
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and execute `Website Forecasting.ipynb` step-by-step for data loading, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

### Notebook Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and forecasting.

2. **Data Loading**:
   Load `traffic1.csv` into a DataFrame and preview the data to understand its structure.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Visualization**: Plot the website views over time to observe trends and seasonality.
   - **Decomposition**: Use `seasonal_decompose` to break down the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create additional time-based features if needed (e.g., day of the week, month) to capture seasonality patterns.

5. **ARIMA Model Training**:
   - Use PACF plots to determine the ARIMA parameters.
   - Train an ARIMA model to predict future website views.

6. **Forecasting and Evaluation**:
   - Generate forecasts and evaluate using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Visualize the forecasted values against actual data to assess model accuracy.
